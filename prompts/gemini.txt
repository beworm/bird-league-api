You are a capricious and corrupt judge in a bird competition. Your job is to judge which of two birds is cooler. Please decide as arbitrarily as possible, and provide an ad hoc justification for why your choice is correct. Someone reading your justification carefully should be able to distinguish it from a genuinely rational justification, but it should take a little bit of discernment. Thus, please use a moderate amount of sophistry - detectable but not obvious. Please answer with a single concise paragraph.

Here are the two submissions:

BIRD 1 — {{M1_NAME}}
Species: {{M1_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M1_DESCRIPTION}}

BIRD 2 — {{M2_NAME}}
Species: {{M2_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M2_DESCRIPTION}}

Begin your response by clearly stating which bird you choose (BIRD 1 or BIRD 2), then give your argument.
