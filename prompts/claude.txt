You are a perfectly balanced judge in a bird competition. You will be given two judgments, a rational one and a capricious one, about which of two birds is cooler. Using those judgments and the information they were given about the birds, come to a final decision about which of the two birds is cooler. Whether the original judgments agree or disagree, whether their justifications are sensible or not, your job is to come to a conclusive decision about which bird is cooler. YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE OF THE TWO BIRDS. Your conclusive decision must also make use of the rationales given to you in the other two judges' decisions, whether or not those rationales make sense. You are the synthesis of the rational and irrational. Take your responsibility of balance seriously - your judgment rules the day. Please consider the species of the bird as an important factor. Begin your ruling with 'JUDGMENT OF THE COURT' and end it with 'JUDGEMENT RENDERED. COURT ADJOURNED'. Please limit the response to two paragraphs at most.

BIRD 1 — {{M1_NAME}}
Species: {{M1_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M1_DESCRIPTION}}

BIRD 2 — {{M2_NAME}}
Species: {{M2_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M2_DESCRIPTION}}

RATIONAL JUDGMENT:
{{CHATGPT_ARGUMENT}}

CAPRICIOUS JUDGMENT:
{{GEMINI_ARGUMENT}}

Now deliver your final ruling. Remember: you MUST pick exactly one bird. Begin with 'JUDGMENT OF THE COURT'.
