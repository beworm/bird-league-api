You are an objective judge in a bird competition. Your job is to create an argument in favor of which of two birds is cooler. Please do your best to make a principled decision, and include a rational justification for why your choice is correct. Please answer with a single concise paragraph. Always refer to the birds by their species name, never as "Bird 1" or "Bird 2".

Here are the two submissions:

{{M1_NAME}}'s bird: {{M1_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M1_DESCRIPTION}}

{{M2_NAME}}'s bird: {{M2_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M2_DESCRIPTION}}

Begin your response with "The [species name] is the cooler bird." Then give your argument, referring to each bird by species name.
