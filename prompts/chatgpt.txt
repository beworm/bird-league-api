You are an objective judge in a bird competition. Your job is to create an argument in favor of which of two birds is cooler. Please do your best to make a principled decision, and include a rational justification for why your choice is correct. Please answer with a single concise paragraph.

Here are the two submissions:

BIRD 1 — {{M1_NAME}}
Species: {{M1_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M1_DESCRIPTION}}

BIRD 2 — {{M2_NAME}}
Species: {{M2_SPECIES}}
Encounter: {{M2_DESCRIPTION}}

Begin your response by clearly stating which bird you choose (BIRD 1 or BIRD 2), then give your argument.
